        <strong><em>"A gem of South India"</em></strong>
      </h2>
      <h3>Visakhapatnam Tourism</h3>
      <p>
        Visakhapatnam, also commonly known as Vizag, is one of the oldest port
        cities in the country. Situated in the heart of Andhra Pradesh, Vizag
        was announced as the state capital of Andhra Pradesh on January 31,
        2023. The city is known for its picturesque beaches and serene
        landscape, as well as a rich cultural past. The port of Visakhapatnam is
        renowned for being home to the oldest shipyard in all of India.
      </p>
      <p>
        Located a short distance away from Visakhapatnam is Araku Valley, one of
        the prime attractions of Vizag. Situated at a lofty 910 metres above sea
        level, Araku Valley is a hill station replete with gushing waterfalls,
        crystal clear streams, lush green gardens and some challenging trekking
        trails. Vizag is dotted with many beaches along its coastline, with the
        most famous one being the Yarada Beach. One of the most stunning places
        to see in all of Visakhapatnam, Yarada beach is surrounded by majestic
        hills on three sides, and by the Bay of Bengal on the other side. One of
        the best things about Vizag’s beaches is that they are a lot cleaner and
        a lot less crowded than other famous beaches along the Indian coastline,
        and Yarada beach is no exception. It is the perfect place to sit back on
        the golden sands and witness a marvellous sunrise or sunset.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re a history lover, the Borra Caves are one of the best tourist
        attractions that Vizag has to offer for you. Nestled amidst the
        Ananthagiri Hills in Araku Valley, the Borra Caves are over thousands of
        years old and are the biggest among all the caves found in India. Made
        entirely of natural karstic limestone, the caves are kaleidoscopic in
        nature, and the light falling on the rocks coupled with the waterfalls
        creates an extremely colourful effect, lending an aura of magic and
        mysticism to the entire ambience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Katiki Waterfalls, situated a short distance away from the Borra
        Caves, is a gushing waterfall that measures around 50 feet in height and
        is completely surrounded by the lush greenery of the valley. The
        crystal-clear water cascading down the rocks, bordered by the gleaming
        green foliage is a sight for sore eyes. Being a coastal area, the
        primary cuisine of Visakhapatnam includes seafood, as well as
        traditional Andhra South Indian cuisine. While Visakhapatnam is not
        exactly renowned for being a shopping destination, you will still find a
        lot of things that you can take back home. You can purchase a wide
        variety of stuff starting from handicrafts to Kalamkari paintings to
        wooden toys to even gorgeous Pochampalli and Ikat sarees.
